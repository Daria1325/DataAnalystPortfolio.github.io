                                    <h3>SCENARIO</h3>
                                    <p>I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
                                        products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
                                        global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
                                        device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of
                                        Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The

                                </div>

                                <h3>DATA</h3>
                                <p>The dataset used is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit" target="_blank">FitBit Fitness Tracker Data</a>, provided by Mobius on Kaggle.
                                    This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.
                                    Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.
                                The dataset containes daily, hourly information as well as by minutes. </p>
                               
                                <div class="process">

                                
                                <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                                <p>To analyze this data, I used Python to clean and orginize information and Tableau to visualize the rezults.</p>
                                  <p> Full <a href="" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">code</a> and <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/DailyWellbeingTrackerAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">dashboard</a> you can find via link</p> 
                            
                                  <p>Firstly I imported packages for future data work</p>
                                  
                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python" >
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import json
                                      </code>
                    
                                  </pre>

                                  <p>Once, libraries were installed, I imported data, that I intent to use for analysis, to DataFrames</p>

                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python">
#import data
daily_activity_df = pd.read_csv('/content/dailyActivity_merged.csv')
hourly_calories_df = pd.read_csv('/content/hourlyCalories_merged.csv')
hourly_intensities_df = pd.read_csv('/content/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv')
hourly_steps_df = pd.read_csv('/content/hourlySteps_merged.csv')
sleep_day_df = pd.read_csv('/content/sleepDay_merged.csv')

                                  </pre>

                                  <p>Next I looked at 5 first raw of each table to better understand data.</p>

                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python">

                                  </pre>
                                  
                                  <p>First thing I noticed is that sleep data in column SleepDay has the same time in each raw, which means we can convert it to date and join with daily_activity table without loosing data.</p>

                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python">
sleep_day_df['SleepDay'].unique()
sleep_day_df['SleepDay'] = pd.to_datetime(sleep_day_df['SleepDay']).dt.date
daily_activity_df['ActivityDate'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_activity_df['ActivityDate']).dt.date
daily_activity_df = pd.merge(daily_activity_df, sleep_day_df, left_on=['Id', 'ActivityDate'], right_on=['Id', 'SleepDay'], how='left')

                                      </code>
                                  </pre>

                                  <p>I proceeded to merge the hourly data, aligning it based on identical datetime and ID values.</p>

                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python">
hourly_activity_df = pd.merge(hourly_steps_df, hourly_calories_df, on=['Id', 'ActivityHour'], how='inner')
hourly_activity_df = pd.merge(hourly_activity_df, hourly_intensities_df, on=['Id', 'ActivityHour'], how='inner')

                                      </code>
                                  </pre>

                                  <p>After that, I proceeded to remove all duplicates from tables.</p>

                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python">
hourly_activity_df =hourly_activity_df.drop_duplicates()
daily_activity_df =daily_activity_df.drop_duplicates()
weight_log_df =weight_log_df.drop_duplicates()
                                      </code>
                                  </pre>

                                  <p>Next, I examined how many unique ids in each table. And found that there are only 8 people in weight log table. Which makes the sample size too small to use for analysis.</p>

                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python">
print('Hourly activity: ', len(hourly_activity_df['Id'].unique()))
print('Daily activity: ', len(daily_activity_df['Id'].unique()))
print('Weight log: ', len(weight_log_df['Id'].unique()))
                                      </code>
                                  </pre>

                                  <p>Finnaly, I exported two tables as CSV files for visualization in Tableau.</p>

                                  <pre class="bg-code">
                                    <code class="language-python">

                                  </pre>

                           
                                  <h3>ANALYZE/SHARE</h3>
                                  <p>For data analysis and visualization I used Tableau. I used calculated fields to convert minutes to hours, implemented binning to group values efficiently.</p>
                                  <p>The first interesting piece of data is the correlation between the number of hours slept, total time in bed and total time in bed without sleep.
                                    The chart distinctly illustrates a strong corelation between hours of sleep and total time spent in bed. Additionally, is shows that  majority of individuals tend to fall asleep
                                    within an hour. Consequently, it is advisable to focus on individuals who spend more than one hour in bed without sleep and have a total sleep duration of less than 7 hours, suggesting a potential need for adjustments in their sleep habits.
                                  </p>
                                  <p class="image fit"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images\CaseStudy\Sleep.png" alt=""></p>
                                  <p>Next interesting discovery about people's sleeping habits is substantial correlation between sedentary hours and sleep duration. 
                                    Individuals with shorter sleep durations tend to exhibit a more sedentary lifestyle.
                                  </p>
                                  <p class="image fit"></p><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images\CaseStudy\SedentaryVsSleep.png" alt=""></p>
                                  <p>Then I wanted to see if the day of the week affects people's sleep.
                                    It is evident from the chart that total hours of sleep exhibit minimal variation across the days. 
                                    However, on Sundays people tend to sleep more and spend more time in bed without sleep compared to other days.
                                    This observation aligns with the the "Average Total Steps by Day of the Week" chart,
                                     which highlights Sunday as the least active day. As a result, it can be said that on Sundays, 
                                     people tend to spend more time resting and show lower levels of physical activity.</p>
                                  <p class="image fit"></p><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images\CaseStudy\SleepByWeek.png" alt=""></p>
                                  <p class="image fit"></p><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images\CaseStudy\StepsByWeek.png" alt=""></p>
                                  <p>In examining the average intensity throughout the day, it is consistent with expectations that individuals are most active from 8 AM to 8 PM, 
                                    reaching the highest peak between 5 PM and 7 PM.</p>
                                  <p class="image fit"></p><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images\CaseStudy\IntensityByDay.png" alt=""></p>
                                  <p>The final observation is the correlation between calories, activity levels, and the type of activity.
                                    The more active people are, the more calories they burn. However, sedentary activities still contribute to the highest calorie burn.
                                  </p>
                                  <p class="image fit"></p><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images\CaseStudy\ActivityCalorie.png" alt=""></p>
